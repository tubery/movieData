# Movie Data

Show movie data and allow user to interact.

## Requirements

---

1. Store the object below in a JavaScript file in your codebase

2. Render the data onto the webpage with DOM Manipulation

3. Allow the user to affect the display of the data by interacting with the
   webpage

4. Allow the user to update the data stored in the object by interacting with
   the webpage

## Planning

---

Will I get points deducted for mostly black and white websites? I hope not as I
am a very boring creative person.

Javascript ramping up I will need to brush up using free code camp.

Created HTML mockup using classes I intend to name

Added movies to web page

Added edit modal for users

Added delete functionality

Added clear all functionality

Added add movies functionality

Since JS is done only styling is left

### Post development

Should have refactored the javascript before submitting as I have chunks of code
that are reused

I think I could have used event bubbling instead of looping through all elements
and adding event listeners

Sanitization and validation should be much better if this were a real website

Add sort option next time and maybe filters

Styling once again very barebones I will have to step it up considerably for the
last two projects

Could have used local storage since I have knowledge of that

Light and dark mode could be an addition or themes

Animations to make it more lively

CSS not very clean currently split into sections

## Building

---

1. Set up scaffoling boilerplate files and HTML

2. Get data showing on page

3. Allow interaction with data

4. Style website
